# Snapshot
Snapshot is a new spin on the age-old game, "Assassin". One study shows that 96% of Americans own a smartphone. These phones likely all have cameras. Our project plans to utilize these cameras to create a new variant of the popular game "Assassin".

## How to Play
1. Game leader creates a game.
2. Players take pictures of their target in order to "assassinate" them.
3. Players upload their pictures in order to confirm an assassination.
4. Snapshot processes the pictures, confirms/denies the assassination, and assigns points for matches.
5. Players are ranked by either the number of "tags" they had or the number of "tags" minus the number of times they were "tagged" depending on the original setting.

## Planned Future Features
* More game modes
* Android and iOS apps
