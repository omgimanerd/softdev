# Bloginator - Software Development Blogging Project

###Description of Project:
This project is a blog website that allows users to create posts that will be displayed on a global
feed, "Dashboard". In order to view or post to the Dashboard, users must be registered through the sign up page
or logged in. Along with access to the globalfeed, user's have access to a personalized page called "My Posts",
where they create posts and can view/edit their previous posts. Once users submit their edits, that post will be
updated on the Dashboard.
